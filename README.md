This project targets the automation of a particular process (which takes about 2 hours). It automatically generates the documentation from a certain input. Basically it scans the excel file/s for anomalies or differences (in the amounts) that the team needs to address or raise to the concerned team. At the release of this automation, the team only needed to run this tool and it only takes them 5-10 minutes for running and double checking of the result.

<h3>Functionalities</h3>
    1. Scans the anomalies or differences from the inputs.<br>

<br>
    2. Documents these differences into a docx file. This way, the raising of issues is standardized, avoid human error, and saves time. It also automatically provides the screenshot of the said anomalies and also add them to the docx file where the formatting (e.g. border, font weight, style, etc.) is already set.<br>

5. Provides the message from the terminal to be displayed in the app itself so that the users and debuggers will have an idea on what's causing the error or if the running is complete or successful.<br>
