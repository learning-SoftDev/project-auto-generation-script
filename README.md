# project-auto-generation-script

This project targets the automation of a particular process (which takes about 2 hours). It automatically generates the documentation from a certain input. Basically it scans the excel file/s for anomalies or differences that the staffs need to address or raise to the concerned team. At the release of this automation, the team only needed to run this tool and it only takes them 5-10 minutes for running and double checking of the result.

Specific functionalities that this tool have:
    1. Scans the anomalies from the inputs and then document these differences into a docx file. This way, the raising of issues is standardized, avoid human error, and saves time.
    2. Auto populates the information that is needed in the documentation such as the name, date, etc.
    3. Automatically provides the screenshot of the said anomalies and also add them to the docx file where the formatting (e.g. border) is already set.
